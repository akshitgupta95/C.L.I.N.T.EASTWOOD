      <li style="font-size:20px">Here is some info about her </li>
      <p class="scenario">
        Alice is looking for a place to stay in Delft for at least 1 year.<br>
        She is an international student and requires registration in the municipality.<br>
        She has no budget constraints as long as the commute time is less than 10 minutes by bike.<br>
        Further, she prefers a place near the city centre and supermarkets.<br> She also prefers a studio compared to sharing.<br>
      </p>
      <li style="font-size:20px">When you are ready, just write "the name assigned to you" on the interface to begin the conversation</li>

    </ul>
